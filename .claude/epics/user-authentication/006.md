# Task: Frontend Authentication UI Components

## Description

Build all frontend authentication pages and reusable UI components including registration, login, email verification, password reset, password change, password strength indicator, social login buttons, and route guards. Mobile-first responsive design required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Registration page (`/register`) with email/password and social login
- [ ] Login page (`/login`) with remember me and social login
- [ ] Email verification page (`/verify-email`)
- [ ] Password reset request page (`/forgot-password`)
- [ ] Password reset completion page (`/reset-password`)
- [ ] Password change UI in user settings
- [ ] Password strength indicator component (real-time, < 200ms)
- [ ] Social login button components (Google, Microsoft)
- [ ] Auth guard component for protected routes
- [ ] All pages mobile-responsive (375px width minimum)
- [ ] Form validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Loading states during API calls
- [ ] Success/error notifications

## Technical Details

**Pages to Build:**

**1. Registration Page (`/register`)**
- Form fields: Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy checkboxes (required)
- Real-time password strength indicator
- Social login buttons (Google, Microsoft) above form
- Client-side validation: email format, password complexity, password match
- On submit: call POST /api/auth/register
- Success state: "Check your email to verify account"
- Error handling: display API errors clearly

**2. Login Page (`/login`)**
- Form fields: Email, Password
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password?" link
- Social login buttons
- On submit: call POST /api/auth/login
- Success: store JWT token, redirect to dashboard
- Error states: invalid credentials, email not verified, account locked, account deactivated
- Show specific error messages from API

**3. Email Verification Page (`/verify-email`)**
- Extract token from URL query parameter
- Auto-call POST /api/auth/verify-email on page load
- Loading state: "Verifying email..."
- Success state: "Email verified! Redirecting to login..."
- Error states: invalid token, expired token
- For expired token: show "Resend verification email" button

**4. Password Reset Request Page (`/forgot-password`)**
- Form field: Email
- On submit: call POST /api/auth/forgot-password
- Always show: "If account exists, reset link sent to {email}"
- Rate limit error: "Too many requests. Please try again later."

**5. Password Reset Page (`/reset-password`)**
- Extract token from URL query parameter
- Form fields: New Password, Confirm Password
- Password strength indicator
- On submit: call POST /api/auth/reset-password
- Success: "Password reset successfully! Redirecting to login..."
- Error: invalid/expired token, password mismatch

**6. Password Change in Settings**
- Form fields: Current Password, New Password, Confirm Password
- Password strength indicator for new password
- On submit: call POST /api/auth/change-password (with JWT token)
- Success notification: "Password changed successfully"
- Error: incorrect current password

**Reusable Components:**

**PasswordStrengthIndicator Component:**
```tsx
<PasswordStrengthIndicator
  password={passwordValue}
  onChange={(strength) => setStrength(strength)}
/>

Features:
- Visual bar: red (weak) → yellow (medium) → green (strong)
- Text label: "Weak", "Medium", "Strong"
- Criteria checklist:
  ✓ At least 8 characters
  ✓ Uppercase letter
  ✓ Lowercase letter
  ✓ Number
  ✓ Symbol
- Real-time update with debounce (200ms)
```

**SocialLoginButton Component:**
```tsx
<SocialLoginButton
  provider="google"
  onClick={handleGoogleLogin}
/>

Features:
- Provider logo (Google/Microsoft)
- Loading state during redirect
- Error handling for OAuth failures
- Styled consistently
```

**AuthGuard Component:**
```tsx
<AuthGuard requireAuth={true}>
  <ProtectedPage />
</AuthGuard>

Features:
- Checks JWT token in localStorage
- Validates token not expired
- Redirects to /login if not authenticated
- Shows loading state while checking
- Optional: check subscription tier
```

**Mobile Responsiveness:**
- All pages work on 375px width (iPhone SE)
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
- Mobile-optimized form inputs
- Proper keyboard types (email, password)
- Autofocus on first field
- Support browser autofill

**Files to Create:**
- `pages/auth/register.tsx`
- `pages/auth/login.tsx`
- `pages/auth/verify-email.tsx`
- `pages/auth/forgot-password.tsx`
- `pages/auth/reset-password.tsx`
- `pages/settings/password.tsx`
- `components/auth/PasswordStrengthIndicator.tsx`
- `components/auth/SocialLoginButton.tsx`
- `components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`
- `components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx` (shared layout)
- `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom hook for auth state
- `utils/authApi.ts` - API client functions

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 003 completed (API endpoints available)
- [ ] Design mockups for all auth pages
- [ ] Terms of Service and Privacy Policy URLs

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (frontend can work independently once API contracts defined)
