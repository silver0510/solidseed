- [ ] Add Zod validation schemas for all endpoints
- [ ] Add phone format validation (+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX)
- [ ] Add email uniqueness error handling
- [ ] Tests written (TDD: before implementation, or after)
- [ ] All tests passing

## Reference

See epic.md sections:
- "API Endpoints" for request/response specifications
