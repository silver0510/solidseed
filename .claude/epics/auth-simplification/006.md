# Task: Prisma Removal - Remove Dependencies and Cleanup

## Description

Remove all Prisma dependencies from package.json, delete Prisma schema and generated files, and update test files to remove Prisma imports. This completes the Prisma removal process.

## Checklist

- [ ] Backup `package.json` to `package.json.backup`
- [ ] Run `npm uninstall @prisma/client @prisma/adapter-pg prisma`
- [ ] Delete `prisma/schema.prisma` file
- [ ] Delete entire `generated/prisma/` directory
- [ ] Remove Prisma imports from `tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts`
- [ ] Remove any other Prisma imports found in test files
- [ ] Update test mocks to use Better Auth responses directly
- [ ] Verify no remaining Prisma references in codebase (grep search)
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure clean dependencies
- [ ] Verify package-lock.json has no Prisma packages
- [ ] Tests written (N/A - dependency cleanup)
- [ ] All tests passing (npm run test:unit and test:integration)
- [ ] Code reviewed
