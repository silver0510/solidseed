# Task: Prisma Removal - Remove Dependencies and Cleanup

## Description

Remove all Prisma dependencies from package.json, delete Prisma schema and generated files, and update test files to remove Prisma imports. This completes the Prisma removal process.

## Checklist

- [x] Backup `package.json` to `package.json.backup`
- [x] Run `npm uninstall @prisma/client @prisma/adapter-pg prisma`
- [x] Delete `prisma/schema.prisma` file
- [x] Delete entire `generated/prisma/` directory
- [x] Delete `prisma.config.ts` file
- [x] Run `npm install` to ensure clean dependencies
- [x] Verified Better Auth uses pg Pool directly (not Prisma)
- [~] Remove Prisma imports from test files - BLOCKED by legacy code (see below)
- [~] Verify no remaining Prisma references - FOUND legacy code still using Prisma
- [~] Verify package-lock.json has no Prisma packages - @prisma/client remains as better-auth peer dep (not used)
- [ ] Tests written (N/A - dependency cleanup)
- [ ] All tests passing - BLOCKED by legacy code breaking
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Issues Found

Legacy code still using Prisma (outside epic scope):
- `services/auth.service.ts` and other service files
- `app/api/test-prisma/route.ts`
- Multiple scripts in `scripts/` directory
- `tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts`

These files reference `generated/prisma/client` which was deleted.
**Impact**: These files will fail if executed.
**Resolution**: Needs separate task to migrate or remove legacy service layer.

## Reference

See epic.md sections:
- "Migration Steps Phase 2: Step 8-9" for removal steps
- "Success Criteria - Dependencies" for cleanup checklist

## Dependencies

- Task 005: Better Auth must be using direct pg Pool before removing Prisma

## Effort: XS (30 minutes)
