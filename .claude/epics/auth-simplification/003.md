# Task: UUID Migration - Validation and Testing

## Description

Comprehensive testing and validation of the UUID migration to ensure all authentication flows work correctly with the new UUID type, IDs are properly generated, and no data integrity issues exist.

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify all tables use UUID type in database schema query
- [ ] Verify all foreign key columns are UUID type
- [ ] Test user registration generates valid UUID for new users
- [ ] Test Google OAuth login generates valid UUID for new users
- [ ] Test email verification works with UUID user IDs
- [ ] Test password reset works with UUID user IDs
- [ ] Test session creation uses UUID session IDs
- [ ] Test client CRUD operations with UUID IDs
- [ ] Verify all foreign key relationships still work
- [ ] Check database indexes are properly rebuilt on UUID columns
- [ ] Run full test suite (npm run test:unit)
- [ ] Run integration tests (npm run test:integration)
- [ ] Manual testing: complete registration → login → OAuth flow
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript type errors (npm run type-check)
- [ ] Tests written (validation queries and E2E tests)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Reference
