# Task: UUID Migration - Documentation Update

## Description

Update all project documentation to reflect the UUID migration, including database schema docs, setup guides, and technical references. This ensures developers understand the new UUID-based architecture.

## Checklist

- [x] Verify `.claude/database/database.dbml` reflects UUID types (already done in Task 001)
- [x] Update `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` with UUID generation information
- [x] Add section about pgcrypto extension and gen_random_uuid()
- [x] Document UUID benefits (storage, performance, type safety)
- [x] Update any code comments that reference CUID or VARCHAR IDs
- [x] Add UUID migration to project changelog/release notes (documented in SUPABASE-SETUP.md)
- [x] Update README if it references ID format (N/A - README doesn't reference ID format)
- [x] Verify PRD and Epic are marked as UUID migration complete (both reflect UUID migration)
- [x] Tests written (N/A - documentation task)
- [x] All tests passing (verify docs don't break anything)
- [x] Code reviewed (documentation review)

## Reference

See epic.md sections:
- "Migration Steps Phase 1: Step 12" for documentation updates
- "Success Criteria - Documentation" for completeness checklist
- "UUID Migration Benefits" table for content to document

## Dependencies

- Task 003: UUID migration must be fully validated before documenting as complete

## Effort: XS (30 minutes)
