- [ ] Update `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` with UUID generation information
- [ ] Add section about pgcrypto extension and gen_random_uuid()
- [ ] Document UUID benefits (storage, performance, type safety)
- [ ] Update any code comments that reference CUID or VARCHAR IDs
- [ ] Add UUID migration to project changelog/release notes
- [ ] Update README if it references ID format
- [ ] Verify PRD and Epic are marked as UUID migration complete
- [ ] Tests written (N/A - documentation task)
- [ ] All tests passing (verify docs don't break anything)
- [ ] Code reviewed (documentation review)
